# <span style="color:rgb(20, 101, 250)"> How to ace your technical and system design interview :

### Each day : 
    - Solve 5-7 questions from any  without timing at the begining ( 4 hours )
    - When tired of leetcode, look for OOP problems to implement from scratch and memorize the underlying technicities
    - 1 Hour of System Design OR 1 Hour of Behavioral principles each day ( 2 hours max )


### Protocol to follow during the interview : 
    - Listen carefully to your interviewer, focus on what she/he says
    - Try to reword the situation for the given problem => give examples ( Think about edge cases, think out loud about them ) 
    - Once you understood the problem => always start with a pseudo code for the brute force solution ( Even if the solution is not optimized )
    - Always start by a brute force solution ( To score a point and to show that you understood the problem)
    - Then ask if you want to code it ( Should we code it ? )
    - After scoring the brute force solution, try to think of a better solution ( Let's think about it with the interviewer)

#### => Interviewers judge how do you think of the approach ( the logic behind it ) before your coding solution, even if you don't provide an optimal solution by the end of the interview, make sure to state how are you going to solve the problem. If you succeed into delivering a well optimized solution, that's great, if not, don't worry about it just make sure to be verbose and declare your logic behind it


#### =>  You create an example for each question asked by the interviewer for both design system and coding problem solving ( Let me try to see if I understood correctly and explain what you understood from the problem, this sentence literally can save you, the least thing you want to happen is you starting to go in a wrong direction from the start and getting the interviewer losing you while doing so )

#### => For each solution, precise the pros ( Time and Space Complexity ALWAYS ), you can also explain the pros and cons of each one for both system design and coding problems


# <span style="color:rgb(253, 0, 0)">  Behavioral Questions :
The ultimate guide for behavioral questions is to use the STAR method.
Situation : Describe the context or background of a specific event or challenge you faced.
Task      : Explain your specific responsibility or role in that situation.
Actions   : Detail the steps you took to address the task or overcome the challenge.
Results   : Share the outcomes of your actions, highlighting what you achieved or learned.

Be brave to take real experiences from your previous jobs and be frank about them, you are always the hero of the situation, there are times when everybody fail and when interviewers ask questions about those type of failures, they want to know how do you behave behind, how you approach problems which is a star skills for engineers

Examples of questions that could be asked :

- Tell me about a time when you were proud of yourself, of you something you made
 
- Tell me about a time when you saved the day 
 
- Tell me about a time when you had an argument with a teamate and how did you manage it 
 
- Tell me about a time when you had to handle a difficult client
 
- Tell me about a time where you screw up ? what did you learn about it ? 
 
- How did people pushback against your proposals ?
 
- What did you make wrong ? where did you fail the most in your previous experiences ?
 
- What would you do if you were back in time ?
 
- Were you right about it ?
 
- Was that the only option you had ? you had other choices options ? Why did you do that ?

#### Advices : 
  - Use I instead of we, they want to know about you as a person
  - Don't sugarcoat your failures 
  - Don't off tangents, stay focused on the question itself and ask clarifying questions
