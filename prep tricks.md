# Protocol : Try to reword the situation => give examples ( maybe think about edge cases ) => brute force solution => then ask if you want to code it ( Should I code it ? ) => Let's try to think of a better solution ( let's think about it )

# He judges how you think of the approach ( logic behind it )

# Once you understood the problem => always start with brute force solution ( with the bad solution )

# You create an example for each question asked by the interviewer for both design system and coding problem solving ( Let me try to see if I understood correctly .... )

# For each solution, precise the pros and cons for each one

# You should give pros and cons for each solution system design interview

# Each day : 
- Solve 5-7 questions from neetcode timed ( 4 hours )
- When tired of leetcode, look for problems to implement from scratch and memorize
- 1 Hour of System Design / 1 Hour of Behavioral principles ( 2 hours max )

# How did people pushback 
# Where did you screw up ( tell me about a time where you screw up ? what did you learn about it ? )
# What did you make wrong
# What would you do if you were back in time
# Were you right about it ?
# Was that the only option you had ? you had other choices options ? Why did you do that ?
# Use I instead of we 
# Don't sugarcoat your failures 
# Don't off tangents, stay focused on the question itself and ask clarifying questions
