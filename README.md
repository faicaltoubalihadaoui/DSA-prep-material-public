## Overview

Data Structures and Algorithms are the backbone of efficient software development. In this repository, you'll find:

- **Tutorials and Explanations:** Detailed articles and guides on various data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithm concepts (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming).
- **Code Samples:** Implementations of key data structures and algorithms in multiple programming languages.
- **Practice Problems:** A curated set of problems to test your understanding and improve your coding skills.
- **Visualizations:** Diagrams and animations to make complex concepts easier to grasp.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/algos:** Essential algorithms to master before technical interviews.
- **/code:** Sample implementations of data structures like heaps, queues, and stacks.
- **/dsa_problems** Practice problems compiled from LeetCode platform, offering a structured roadmap for coding interview preparation.
- **/oop_problems:** Object-Oriented Programming paradigms and project examples.
- **/special_dsa:** Combined data structures leveraging the strengths of multiple structures, including project examples.
- **/python:** Miscellaneous Python scripts demonstrating various concepts.
